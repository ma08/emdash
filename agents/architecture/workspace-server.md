# Workspace Server

The Workspace Server (`apps/workspace-server/`) is a Node daemon that runs on a remote machine and exposes workspace runtimes (git, files, deps, ACP, …) to Emdash clients over the `@emdash/wire` protocol. Clients connect over an SSH-forwarded Unix socket; the daemon is independently lived and can be running when clients upgrade, downgrade, or are absent entirely.

The desktop client and managed installation flow live in
`apps/emdash-desktop/src/core/services/hosts/node/workspace-server/`. For an SSH host, the runtime
broker asks `HostService` (`core/services/hosts/`) for a runtime client. It coordinates the
existing `SshConnectionManager`, workspace-server provisioning, and `WireConnectionManager`.
`WireConnectionManager` owns dial/initialize, reconnecting transports, and one pinned Wire client
per target until lifecycle invalidation or shutdown. The broker only resolves clients and does not
own connection lifetime. Ordinary SSH disconnects preserve the pinned connection; terminal Wire
failures, exhausted SSH reconnects, and machine edits invalidate it.

Managed Linux installations use `~/.emdash/workspace-server/` with immutable version directories,
an atomic `current` symlink, staging and install-lock paths, and an explicitly selected socket under
`run/`. When the daemon is absent or negotiation reports `upgrade-server`, the desktop downloads
the channel pointer for its protocol major, then downloads and executes that version's immutable
`apps/workspace-server/install.sh` on the remote with the selected version pinned. Canary desktops
fall back to the stable pointer when no canary pointer exists. The script detects Linux architecture
and glibc support, pulls the matching artifact, verifies its SHA-256 sidecar, and extracts it before
`current` changes. Compatible same-major daemons remain installed until a future explicit update.
The desktop offers that update only when the channel pointer names a strictly newer SemVer artifact
version; equal and older pointer versions leave the running daemon alone.
`EMDASH_WORKSPACE_SERVER_ARTIFACTS_URL` overrides the install-script and artifact base URL for
development; the Docker remote dev setup publishes Linux builds to local minio and uses
`http://minio:9000/emdash-releases/workspace-server` so remote installation exercises the same
curl-based object-store path as production. Provisioning verifies that every successful install
selected the exact version named by the resolved channel pointer.

The contract lives in `packages/core/src/workspace-server/`, shared by the server and every client so TypeScript clients stay in sync at build time. Non-TypeScript clients (e.g. a future mobile app) use the negotiation handshake at runtime — compile-time sharing is a convenience, not the contract.

The daemon is the Electron-free equivalent of the desktop runtime host. Every core runtime is a
required supervised child worker in both socket and stdio modes: ACP, agent config, automations,
conversations, file search, files, Git, host settings, resource usage, scripts, terminals, TUI
agents, and workspace registry. The filesystem watcher is also a worker because it is the shared
dependency for files, Git, file search, and the workspace registry. The workspace registry depends
on host settings and scripts: it owns the reactive project-config model, resolves lifecycle
commands and shell setup, and sends strict execution inputs to scripts. Automations starts last and
depends on the workspace registry: automation workspace activation flows through the registry's
`createWorkspace` and `activateWorkspace` verbs. Server startup fails if any required worker cannot
become ready; there are no unavailable-domain fallback implementations in the aggregate controller.

The parent mounts each complete runtime contract under `workspaceWireContract`. Aggregate
forwarding rebinds live endpoint definitions to their namespaced contract ids while retaining the
standalone worker client's upstream topic handles, and translates mutation cursor model ids to the
same aggregate namespace. Runtime-owned persistence lives below the workspace-server state
directory, including automation and file-search databases, session intents, ACP attachments, and
other runtime state. Repository and worktree placement is desktop-owned; the server reports its
structured home path and filesystem `PathProfile` through the files runtime and executes plans
containing absolute paths. The profile is optional on the wire so current clients remain compatible
with older same-major servers. Managed remote Windows hosts are rejected as unsupported before the
POSIX home, layout, installer, or daemon paths run.

Host dependencies are mounted under `workspaceWireContract.hostDependencies`.
The daemon parent owns one local `HostDependencies` component backed by a JSON-file
`KeyValueStore` under the workspace-server state directory and forwards only the narrow resolver
contract into process-spawning child runtimes. The full contract remains available to clients for
inspection, refresh, explicit PATH selection, and plugin-declared update commands. This keeps
workspace-server dependency state local to the remote host while preserving the same source and
selection model used by the desktop SQLite-backed component.

Port-forward inspection is mounted under `workspaceWireContract.portForwards`.
The daemon probes its own loopback interfaces and reports whether a requested
port is accepting connections on IPv4, IPv6, or both. Desktop clients can use
this as the wire control plane before opening a transport-native data stream for
preview traffic.

## Protocol Version

The wire contract is versioned with a single [semver](https://semver.org) string, defined in
[`packages/core/src/workspace-server/versions/index.ts`](../../packages/core/src/workspace-server/versions/index.ts):

```ts
export const PROTOCOL_VERSION = '7.1.0';
```

### What each component means

| Component | Meaning | Compatibility |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **major** | Breaking wire change — removed or retyped field, changed procedure name, changed framing | Incompatible across differing majors |
| **minor** | Additive, backward-compatible — new procedure, new optional field, new ignorable event kind | Compatible; negotiated feature level is `min(clientMinor, serverMinor)` |
| **patch** | No wire impact — bugfix, performance, internal refactor | Always compatible; informational only, ignored by negotiation |

**Compatibility rule**: same major implies compatible. On a major mismatch, the lower major is the stale side and determines the upgrade prompt.

## Behavior-Change and Versioning Rules

### When to bump minor (additive, non-breaking)

- Adding a new procedure.
- Adding an optional field to an existing request or response schema (must be `.optional()` or carry a default; never add a required field in a minor bump).
- Adding a new event kind to an event iterator output where old clients can safely ignore the unknown kind.
- Introducing opt-in behavior that is gated on `agreedMinor >= N` — the client checks `agreedMinor` and falls back gracefully when the server doesn't offer it.

### When to bump major (breaking)

- Removing or renaming a field, procedure, or error variant.
- Changing the type or semantics of an existing field.
- Changing how requests are framed or how errors are encoded on the wire.
- Adding an event kind that old clients **must** handle (rather than ignore).

### When to bump patch (no wire change)

- Fixing a bug that does not alter observable wire behavior.
- Internal performance or correctness improvements.

### Never do these

- Silently change the semantics of an existing call at the same version.
- Add a required field to an existing schema in a minor bump.
- Repurpose an existing field for a different meaning — add a new field and deprecate the old one.
- Remove a field or procedure without a major bump and a deprecation window.

### Discriminated unions

The contract uses many discriminated unions (e.g. `GitPathInspection`, `GitStatusModel`, error unions). Adding a new variant is a **minor bump only if** old clients can safely ignore unknown variants with a default/fallback branch. If the client must handle the new variant to function correctly, it is a **major bump**.

### Schema parsing and unknown fields

Zod strips unknown keys on `.parse()` by default. This is the correct behavior for a tolerant reader: an old client receiving a new response silently ignores new fields. Do not rely on parse to preserve unknown fields if the value is forwarded elsewhere.

## Initialize Handshake

Every client must call `initialize` before using a new connection for workspace operations. `health`
is the only pre-initialization exception because daemon lifecycle probes use it to distinguish an
absent daemon from an incompatible one. Because the daemon is independently lived, `initialize`
must be re-called on every reconnect: the daemon may have changed versions between connections.

The reconnecting desktop transport treats `connectOnce` as a readiness barrier. A candidate stream
is not installed, queued messages are not flushed, and live topics are not reattached until the
candidate's `initialize` call succeeds. A protocol incompatibility is permanent for that client
version and stops the reconnect loop; ordinary I/O failures remain retryable.

### Request (client → server)

```ts
{
  protocolVersion: string;  // the client's PROTOCOL_VERSION
  client: {
    id: string;             // stable client identity for operation attribution
    appVersion: string;
  };
}
```

### Response (server → client)

```ts
{
  protocolVersion: string;  // the server's own PROTOCOL_VERSION
  agreedVersion: string;    // major.min(clientMinor, serverMinor).0
  agreedMinor: number;      // clients gate minor-guarded features on this
  server: {
    appVersion: string;
    daemonId: string;       // stable per-process identity, set at startup
    startedAt: number;      // Unix ms when the daemon started
  };
}
```

### Failure: protocol-incompatible

When majors differ, the fallible `initialize` procedure returns a typed error:

```ts
{
  type: 'protocol-incompatible';
  action: 'upgrade-client' | 'upgrade-server';
  clientProtocolVersion: string;
  serverProtocolVersion: string;
}
```

`action` is `'upgrade-client'` when the client major is lower (stale desktop app) and `'upgrade-server'` when the client major is higher (stale daemon). Use `protocolUpgradeMessage(action)` from `@emdash/core/workspace-server` to produce a consistent user-facing string.

### Negotiation flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Client
  participant S as WorkspaceServer
  C->>S: initialize { protocolVersion, client }
  S->>S: negotiateProtocol(clientVersion, PROTOCOL_VERSION)
  alt same major
    S-->>C: ok { agreedVersion, agreedMinor, server }
    Note over C: gate minor-guarded features on agreedMinor
  else differing major
    S-->>C: err protocol-incompatible { action }
    Note over C: show protocolUpgradeMessage(action) to user
  end
```

### Gating a minor-guarded feature (example)

```ts
// Server introduces a new subscribe feature at protocol 1.1.0.
// Clients with agreedMinor >= 1 may call it; others fall back to polling.
const session = await connect(client);
if (session.agreedMinor >= 1) {
  // use git.worktree.subscribe
} else {
  // fall back to polling
}
```

The desktop forwards the read-only agent hook-status procedure to the selected host's
`agent-config` runtime. Local and remote runtimes expose the same procedure from the same build.
